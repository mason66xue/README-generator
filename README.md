# Node README Generator

## Description

This is my README Generator.  It uses node.js to generate a full README after prompting the user for varioius types of input.  The purpose of this project was to practice my use of node.js, npm installation and usage, callback functions, and how to pass data from one function to another.  While this program generates a well-formed README, there are some further adjustements to be made to give the user more control over their README, such as badge colors, the inclusion of certain sections, and maybe validation to ensure that appropriate input was given.

## Installation

This program requires installation of inquirer npm.

## Usage

To use this program, first open index.js in the intergrated terminal.  Then install the npm inquirer v8.2.4.  When this is done, run index in node and answer all the questions when prompted.  After all questions are answered, a README file populated with the information given in the prompts will be generated into the output folder.
